                    cars aswell as some interesting topics <br />such as what
                    the future holds for cars aswell as some advice on owning a

            <h1>Favourite Cars</h1>
            <p>
                Ever since I was little, I've had a fascination and admiration
                for 'JDM' (Japanese Domestic Market) cars.<br />
                I'm not quite sure where I first saw them (maybe in a video
                game), but there was something about them that caught my eye.
                <br />
                The first JDM car I came across and fell in love with was the
                Nissan GT-R (R34)
            </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="fav-col" id="GTR">
                    <h3>Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Nissan GT-R (R34) nicknamed 'Godzilla' is a widely
                        known and loved JDM car. Famed for its aggresive looks
                        and incredible performance, boasting an in-line 6-cyl,
                        twin-turbo engine with 4WD. It is usually modified to
                        increase its performance to mind boggling figures.
                        Enough to give high performance 'Exotic' cars a run for
                        their money.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mazda RX-7</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my time learning more about JDM cars and playing
                        video games, I got really into drifting. And when you
                        talk about drifting and JDM cars, the car that has to be
                        in the conversation is the RX-7. A rear wheel drive car
                        with a roatary engine (infamously known) that can go
                        around a corner in fashion.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="fav-col" id="Supra">
                    <h3>Toyota Supra MK4</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Toyota Supra MK4 was a car that was able to
                        challenge cars in a variety of races. Be it a circuit
                        race, a sprint or a drifting challenge. Because of its
                        rear wheel drive, you're able to have fun with it around
                        corners and let the back slide out. But it could also
                        output performance on par with the Nissan Skyline and
                        outperform Exotic cars.
